## Wordle

A compilation of miscellaneous projects related to [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), the popular word game.

These projects include:
1. Code to scrape tweets with self-reported Wordle results (written in Python using the Twitter API and run continuously with Github Actions)
2. An analysis to find strong starting word(s) for Wordle. Mildly inspired by other articles/videos, including [this video from 3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA).
